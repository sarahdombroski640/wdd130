            <p>My name is Sarah. I like to read, watch tv, and dance. I really enjoy hanging out with my friends and family. Ice cream and cookie dough are my favorite treats, especially when they are together. I also really like pizza. I love being outdoors and going camping and hiking. I also enjoy doing mysteries and escape rooms. I am currently 18, and I have four semesters left of college.</p>

            <p>Idaho is best known for being the potato state. Boise is the capital, and the mountain bluebird is the state bird. There are many interesting things about Idaho. Did you know we have a conspiracy theory website that Idaho doesn't actaully exist!?!</p>
